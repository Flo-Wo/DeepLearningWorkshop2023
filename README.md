# Deep Learning Workshop 2023: Preparation and Installation Guide

Welcome to the Github page of the Deep Learning Workshop, we are glad
you found your way here. This guide contains instructions on how to
set up your programming environment as well as on how you can 
prepare yourself for the workshop, so we can all get started together.

## Installation guide
Check the ``./00_Preparation/Installation.md`` file and follow the instructions listed there.

## Preparation
The preparation we provide consists of three steps: 1) a theoretical introduction and
2) an introduction to PyTorch. Both are available online for free. 
Additionally, we  provide a preparation assignment which explains the general concept of the workshop
and you can make yourself familiar with the dataset we will use in the first assignment.

Depending on your knowledge, part 1) or part 2) might be redundant for you. If not, please use the chance to
acquire the basics provided, so that we can turn our attention towards more interesting topics
sooner in the workshop. In any case you should work through part 3).

### 1) Theoretical Introduction
Read chapter 5 of the Book: "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al., see
[here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

### 2) Introduction to PyTorch
Work through the examples listed here: [Introduction to PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).
If you have a Microsoft and/or Google Colab Account, the introduction is executable online. Otherwise this might
be a good opportunity to check whether the installation process above worked.

### 3) Preparation Assignment
Open the file ``./00_Preparation/00_Preparation.pdf`` and follow the instructions listed there. We will provide
a **solution proposal two weeks before the workshop takes place**.
